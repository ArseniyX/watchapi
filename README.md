critical for MVP

1. Save requests to database - requests aren't persisted (only in localStorage)
2. Basic monitoring - scheduled checks for saved endpoints
3. Response status tracking - success/failure history
4. Simple uptime dashboard - show which APIs are up/down
5. Basic alerts - email/webhook when endpoint fails

Important but Can Wait

6. Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
7. Response time charts (trending over time)
8. Error rate analytics
9. Team collaboration (sharing collections)

Advanced (Post-MVP)

-   AI anomaly detection
-   CI/CD integration
-   GraphQL/gRPC support
-   Advanced analytics/forecasting
-   Cost optimization insights
-   Slack/Teams integrations

ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps for MVP

1. Connect Analytics to Real Data (High Priority - differentiator)
2. Team Management (High Priority - enables Team tier pricing)
3. Export Functionality (Medium Priority - common feature request)
4. Environment Tags (Medium Priority - professional feature)
5. Templates (Low Priority - nice to have)
