# Why I build WatchAPI

Our team and I used postman for apis, the problem we have with postman that it's pretty expensive and our usecase was very simple, just to handle api cross team in sync and just to make sure important apis like checkout keep working. So basic apis and monitoring system. So to achieve that we would need to pay pretty much money postman and datadog just to get this two features. We found it inpractical so we basically used postman json to sync manually, and we not used monitoring at all so things basically working on luck and hope its not brake.

After I had sometime I realized this painful problem is not been solved so I did WatchAPI simple API monitoring for teams.
